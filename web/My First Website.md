# My First Website
by CodeTiger

## Challenge
I just built my first website! I heard there might be a flag on it too
http://websites.litctf.live/

The first part of the flag is in the really fast text on the screen.

It's highlighted because I did ctrl-f.
I found the second part of the flag in the source code, though you could also find it by clicking on the button with "AMAZING COLOURS".

Flag: ```flag{1_l1k3_d351gns}```
