## Challenge

There's three parts to the flag.

1. The first part of the flag is in the really fast text on the screen, which you can also find by inspecting the page and searching for "flag".

2. The second part of the flag is also found by searching for "flag" in the source code.

3. I found the third part of the flag in the source code, though you could also find it by clicking on the button with "AMAZING COLOURS".

Flag: ```flag{1_l1k3_90s_w3bs1t3s_d351gns}```
