Problem Statement
You are a CS teacher at Lexington High School with a class of N students. After a final exam, you were curious to see what the total score of your all students is.

Feeling a bit lazy, you decided that instead of summing all the scores by hand, you would write a program to calculate the total value

Additional Notes
This problem does not reflect the difficulty of this contest, but is merely for familiarization and testing purposes.
Time limit for Java and C++ is 2.5 seconds, and for Python is 5 seconds.
Memory limit for all languages is 128mb
Finally, the problem uses standard IO(so not reading files)

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ a_i ≤ 100

Input format
The first line contains a single integer, N, the total number of students. The second line contains N integers, with the i th number being a_i, the score of the i th student.

Output format
You should output an integer, that indicates the sum of all the scores

Sample inpt
5
99 64 12 57 82

Sample output
314

# Solution
I honestly don't expect anyone to have trouble with this, which is the whole point of this sample "challenge". I attached my own c++ solution though.
