make folders for each category

make folders for a challenge if it has file attachments like rev or pwn or steg

*CHANGES*:
- made separate folder named standard-round for the programming challenges
  - inside is a folder for the sample problems (I know that makes for a lot of nested folders and convoluted directories but its the only way that makes sense in my head)
