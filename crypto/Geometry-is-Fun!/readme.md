# Geometry is Fun!
by Andrew Shin

## Challenge
We all love GEOMETRY, let's reminisce of all the times our teacher told us to find how large a certain figure is! Remember, Geometry teachers are bad at encrypting messages so the encryption method is not hard :D
(Note that the graphs may not be precise - only use angles/lengths notated in the diagrams)

## Solution (thanks to wyl3wak for the encoding method)
Solving each triangle for their area gets us the following list of numbers: ```9_12_15_22_5_7_5_15```.
Putting this in a a1z26 (number to alphabet) decoder, we get our flag!

flag: ```flag{ilovegeo}```
