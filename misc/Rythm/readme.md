# Rythm
by CodeTiger

## Challenge
What is that strange melody composed of only 4 notes I hear? I must decrypt it!
(Hint: You might need relative/perfect pitch for this challenge)

## Solution (TO FINISH)
The first part is relatively straightforward: transcribe the audio file into notes on paper (or computer) that you can later decrypt (I have that attached as a text file).

We get only four notes (c,d,e,f).
With the encoding ```c = 0, d = 1, e = 2, f = 3```, we get something in base 4. TODO
