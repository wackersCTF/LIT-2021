## Challenge
Temples are also cool, try to find the two templesâ€™ coordinates! The flag is flag{lat1,long1,lat2,long2} where the first two describe the first location, and the last two describe the second location.

## Solution
A lot of thanks to some of my relatives who gave me some tips on how to get the coordinates and find what building is in the picture. I didn't actually solve this challenge in the competition because I was late by a few seconds with some weird rounding problems :(

1. The first image can be found if you can read Chinese (which I can't).

2. The second image can be found by plugging it into google lens which apparently most people use via the google app on their phone.

flag: ```flag{25.709,100.147,34.914,135.806}```

As a testament to how close I was to solving this challenge, I attached a txt file with my notes right before the competition ended. As you can see, I had the right flag :(
