## Solution 

They give you a video file so the first thing you do is actually watch the video to see if theres anything weird.

If you watch carefully, a small text pops up for like 0.1 secs on the screen, which is most probably our flag.

Now you can try to be insane and catch the flag at the exact time but an easier way to do this challenge is to use a video cutter.

The video frame cutter I used: https://online-video-cutter.com/

Upload the file to the site and trim the video to where the green text appears.

It might be light if you stop it a little too early but it's better than nothing.

That's our flag!!

Flag: ```flag{c0detiger_0rz}```
