## Challenge
Hereâ€™s an easy CTF problem for demonstration purposes. I will go get some caesar salad while you solve this.

## Solution
Inside the text file, we have an encrypted string, synt{j4yp0z3_g0_PGS}. It is encrypted in rot13 (Caesar Cipher with shift of 13). Using this [website](https://rot13.com), we get our flag.

Flag: **flag{w4lc0m3_t0_CTF}**
